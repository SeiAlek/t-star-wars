# Star Wars Characters

- [App Link](https://seialek.github.io/t-star-wars/#/)
- [Task](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H4u-DXB1Ng_vgbLl3E2xvuRzpOYkT_bD97IHDmZ8_ng/edit?usp=sharing)


## Technologies

- React
- Material UI
- Axios


## Functionality

The application must load all data from SWAPI (peoples, filmes, starships, species). This is required to implement sorting on the client.

Two filtering modes are implemented:

1. Mode AND. In this mode, characters are included in the selection if they meet all the criteria.
2. Mode OR. The sample contains characters that meet at least one of the criteria.


## Unrealized

No favorites with DragnDrop (not hard task, if I had enough time I would implement it with react-dnd).
