## Functionality

The application must load all data from SWAPI (peoples, filmes, starships, species). This is required to implement sorting on the client.

Two filtering modes are implemented:

1. Mode AND. In this mode, characters are included in the selection if they meet all the criteria.
2. Mode OR. The sample contains characters that meet at least one of the criteria.

Characters can be added to favorites (saved in localStorage) and removed from it. Adding to favorites is implemented through drag and drop.
